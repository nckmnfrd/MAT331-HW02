    "Write a function that takes as input an integer $n$ and returns its factorization into prime numbers.  The output should be a list of the prime factors, with each prime $p$ appearing $k$ times in the list where $k$ is the largest power of $p$ such that $p^k$ divides $n$.  The order of the elements of the list does not matter.  For instance, if $n=12$, any of [2,2,3], [2,3,2], or [3,2,2] would be vaild outputs. Do not use the built-in factor function.  Test your function on $2^{22}-1, 2^{23}-1$, and $2^{24}-1$.  "
